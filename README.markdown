Exanpe T5 Lib
-------------

Exanpe T5 Lib is a library of components design for the J2EE Tapestry 5 framework, developed by the Exanpe organization.

The purpose of this library is to provide additional components to Tapestry 5 as well as skinning the native components.

Our final purpose is to provide a fully harmonized set of components, ready to be included in your web application.

Easy to use and to integrate, this library target the real needs of any web application, taking a real care of possible application conflicts as well as depending on a minimal number of third party library !

The library is fully :

  - Integrated with Maven 2
